# Current Reads & Favorites

Heeeere are some books I’ve been diving into lately:  

- *House of Leaves* by Mark Z. Danielewski — trippy, layered storytelling  
- *The Master and Margarita* by Mikhail Bulgakov — absurd, darkly funny  
- *Gödel, Escher, Bach* by Douglas Hofstadter — mind-bending and endlessly fascinating  
- *Slaughterhouse-Five* by Kurt Vonnegut — chaotic, tragic, darkly humorous
